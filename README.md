About
-----

GoEssentials is a grouping of all the functions I've found myself repeatedly copy/pasting from project to project. Many functions, like [GetConfig()](https://github.com/ChristianHering/GoEssentials/blob/master/config.go#L23), are useful in a wide range of projects spanning web development, cli applications, usermode services, and more!

Installing and Compiling from Source
------------

In order to use functions from GoEssentials, you'll need the following:

  * [Go](https://golang.org) installed and [configured](https://golang.org/doc/install)
  * A little patience :)

Then simply get GoEssentials and start using it!

```sh
go get github.com/ChristianHering/GoEssentials
```
